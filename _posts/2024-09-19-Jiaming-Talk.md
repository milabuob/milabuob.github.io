On 8 November 2024, at 4 pm (UK time), our own Jiaming Cao will be giving a research webinar about his most recent work on developing algorithms for diffuse optical tomography (DOT). The talk, entitled "Spatio-temporal tomography of the brain: the DOT-EEG fusion algorithm and the new NIRFASTer," will be divided into two parts. In the first part of the webinar, he will present a novel algorithm that synthesizes simultaneously recorded DOT and EEG signals for high spatio-temporal resolution neuronal source reconstruction. For the second part, Jiaming will introduce his current work in progress: an updated version of NIRFASTer, the commonly used photon forward modeling software, which is now Python-based, and even faster. 

The talk will be hosted by the [NIRx Webinars](https://nirx.net/webinars){:target="_blank"}, and everyone can register on [this link](https://nirx-net.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZclfuGuqDkqGtPWw0JlBT839-T7PgwDi2M2#/registration){:target="_blank"}.
