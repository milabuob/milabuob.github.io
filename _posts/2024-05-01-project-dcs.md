In this project, we are developing new neuroimaging techniques that allow for more precise mapping of brain activity. These innovations aim to improve the diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders by providing clearer and more detailed images of the brain.

### Objectives

- Develop advanced imaging techniques.
- Improve diagnostic tools.
- Enhance understanding of brain function.

### Methods

We use a variety of imaging tools and techniques, including:

- MRI
- fMRI
- PET scans
