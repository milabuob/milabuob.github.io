From August 21 to 23, 2024, Dr. Rickson Mesquita visited Western University in London, Ontario, Canada. During his visit, Dr. Mesquita served as a member of a PhD defense committee and delivered an invited talk to faculty and students. The talk focused on his pioneering research in fNIRS reproducibility at the single-subject level. The presentation highlighted the importance of reliable and reproducible measurements in science, and how to achieve reproduble results when measuring brain function with fNIRS. 

This visit further strengthened the ongoing collaboration between Dr. Mesquita's research group and several researchers at Western University. Their partnership focuses on advancing neuroimaging techniques, with a particular emphasis on improving fNIRS methodologies for clinical applications. The discussions held during the visit helped to refine joint research goals and explore new avenues for collaborative studies, reinforcing the impact of their collective efforts on the global neuroimaging community.
