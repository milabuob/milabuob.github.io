  bio: "Jiaming's research mainly concerns with algorithmic improvements to enable high accuracy imaging using DOT and EEG. 
  He is currently working on the BioSMART project, where he is developing a deep learning based method for fluorescence DOT imaging 
  of bioreactors. He is also a maintainer of the NIRFASTer toolbox. Before joining MI lab, Jiaming obtained his PhD degree in 
  Biomedical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Prof. Jana Kainerstorfer and Prof. Pulkit Grover.
  Jiaming’s interest in optics and imaging also extends to photography, especially of the analog kind. He also likes to explore 
  cooking different cuisines and is a guitar player."
