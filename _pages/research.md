Our lab consists of a number of multi and cross disciplinary projects working on the development of physical and computational sciences as applied to medical imaging. Our research ranges from development of diffuse optical techniques, to computational tools assisting image guided interventions.

    <h2>Optical Instrumentation</h2>

      <p>Despite counting with several commercial diffuse optical devices in our lab, we actively develop purpose-driven optical 
      technology to tackle research problems. Our lab focuses on developing systems such as devices for diffuse optical tomography (DOT), fluorescence imaging, and most recently, diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS).</p>

    <h2>Light Transport in Biological Tissue</h2>
    <div class="research-content">
      <p>We actively work on analytical and numerical models for studying light propagation in turbid media such as biological tissue. Part of our work is available for free use, such as the FEM-based NIRFAST.</p>

    <h2>Functional Neuroimaging Analysis</h2>
    <div class="research-content">
      <img src="/assets/images/rsFC.gif" alt="Brain functional connectivity at rest">
      <p>Great part of our work encompasses better and more general ways to rationalize data provided by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). To this end, we study the biases present in the fNIRS signal and proposing potential ways to circumvent them or alleviate their impact, improving the signal quality. We also make use of physical models to develop associative and causal statistical models for analyzing the brain connectivity. More recently, part of our group exploits topological spaces such as manifolds to encode observations about brain behaviour and from there answer segregational and integration questions about brain function.</p>
